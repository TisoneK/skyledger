# Navigation Toolbar Proposal

A dedicated navigation toolbar component to provide persistent access to common Quick Actions across the SkyLedger application, replacing the current embedded Quick Actions section in the weekly snapshot.

## Current Issue

The Quick Actions section is currently embedded within the weekly snapshot component body, wrongly placed in the middle of the content instead of being positioned in the navigation toolbar where it belongs.
